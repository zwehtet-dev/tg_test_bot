## âœ… Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. On VPS - Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd currency_exchange_bot/tg_bot
```

### 3. On VPS - Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Edit these required variables:
- [ ] `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your_bot_token>`
- [ ] `ADMIN_GROUP_ID=<your_admin_group_id>`
- [ ] `BALANCE_TOPIC_ID=3` (or your topic ID)
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_key>`

### 4. On VPS - Deploy

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 5. Verify Deployment

- [ ] Check container is running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- [ ] Look for initialization messages:
  ```
  Starting database initialization...
  Bank accounts initialization complete: 9 accounts added
  Bot settings initialization complete
  ```
- [ ] Send `/start` to bot in Telegram
- [ ] Bot responds with menu
- [ ] Admin commands work in admin group

## âœ… Post-Deployment Verification

### Test User Flow
- [ ] User can start exchange
- [ ] User can upload receipt
- [ ] OCR extracts information correctly
- [ ] Admin receives notification
- [ ] Admin can upload receipt
- [ ] Admin can select bank
- [ ] User receives confirmation with admin receipt

### Test Admin Commands

- [ ] `/settings` shows configuration

### Test Balance Updates
- [ ] Balance updates post to correct topic
- [ ] Balance overview is included
- [ ] All bank balances are shown

## âœ… Monitoring

- [ ] Set up log monitoring: `docker-compose logs -f`

- [ ] Document admin procedures

## âœ… Backup Strategy

- [ ] Database backup command documented
- [ ] Backup schedule established
- [ ] Backup restoration tested

## ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Complete!

If all items are checked, your bot is ready for production use!

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# Restart bot
docker-compose restart

# Stop bot
docker-compose down

# Update bot
git pull && docker-compose up -d --build

# Backup database
cp data/exchange_bot.db data/exchange_bot.db.backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

1. **Check logs first**: `docker-compose logs -f exchange-bot`
2. **Verify .env**: `docker-compose config`
3. **Check container**: `docker-compose ps`
4. **Restart**: `docker-compose restart`
5. **Rebuild**: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build`

## Support

- Review `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions
- Check logs for error messages
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure bot has proper permissions in Telegram group
