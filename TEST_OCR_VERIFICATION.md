# Testing OCR Verification

## How to Test Admin Receipt Verification

### Setup
1. Deploy the bot to VPS
2. Ensure bot is running: `docker-compose ps`
3. Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

### Test Scenario 1: Correct Amount ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. User starts exchange: THB ‚Üí MMK
2. User uploads receipt showing 1,000 THB
3. Bot calculates: 121,500 MMK (with rate 121.5)
4. Bot sends to admin group
5. **Admin replies with receipt showing 121,500 MMK**

**Expected Logs:**
```
INFO - Starting receipt verification for transaction #123, currency: MMK, expected: 121500.0
INFO - üîç Running OCR on admin receipt for transaction #123
INFO - OCR result for transaction #123: {'amount': '121500', ...}
INFO - üí∞ Amount detected: 121500.0 MMK (expected: 121500.0 MMK)
INFO - ‚úÖ Amount verified for transaction #123: 121500.0 MMK (diff: 0.0 MMK, within 1000 MMK tolerance)
```

**Expected Bot Response:**
```
‚úÖ Receipt saved for Transaction #123

üí∞ Amount: 1,000.00 THB ‚Üí 121,500 MMK
üè¶ User's Bank: KBZ - 123456789

üì§ Select which MMK bank you used for transfer:
[Bank buttons]
```

**No warning shown** ‚úÖ

### Test Scenario 2: Small Difference (Within Tolerance) ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. User exchange: 1,000 THB ‚Üí 121,500 MMK
2. **Admin replies with receipt showing 121,000 MMK**

**Expected Logs:**
```
INFO - üí∞ Amount detected: 121000.0 MMK (expected: 121500.0 MMK)
INFO - ‚úÖ Amount verified for transaction #123: 121000.0 MMK (diff: 500.0 MMK, within 1000 MMK tolerance)
```

**Expected Bot Response:**
- No warning shown
- Shows bank selection buttons

**Difference: 500 MMK (within 1000 tolerance)** ‚úÖ

---

### Test Scenario 3: Amount Mismatch (Warning) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Steps:**
1. User exchange: 1,000 THB ‚Üí 121,500 MMK
2. **Admin replies with receipt showing 120,000 MMK**

**Expected Logs:**
```
INFO - üí∞ Amount detected: 120000.0 MMK (expected: 121500.0 MMK)
WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è AMOUNT MISMATCH in transaction #123: expected 121500.0, detected 120000.0, diff 1500.0
```

**Expected Bot Response:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Amount Mismatch Warning

Transaction #123
Expected: 121,500 MMK
Detected: 120,000 MMK
Difference: 1,500 MMK

Please verify the receipt shows the correct amount before proceeding.

---

‚úÖ Receipt saved for Transaction #123
[Bank buttons still shown]
```

**Warning shown, but can still proceed** ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

### Test Scenario 4: Major Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Steps:**
1. User exchange: 1,000 THB ‚Üí 121,500 MMK
2. **Admin replies with receipt showing 100,000 MMK**

**Expected Logs:**
```
INFO - üí∞ Amount detected: 100000.0 MMK (expected: 121500.0 MMK)
WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è AMOUNT MISMATCH in transaction #123: expected 121500.0, detected 100000.0, diff 21500.0
```

**Expected Bot Response:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Amount Mismatch Warning

Transaction #123
Expected: 121,500 MMK
Detected: 100,000 MMK
Difference: 21,500 MMK

Please verify the receipt shows the correct amount before proceeding.
```

**Large difference - likely wrong receipt** ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Test Scenario 5: OCR Cannot Detect Amount

**Steps:**
1. User exchange: 1,000 THB ‚Üí 121,500 MMK
2. **Admin replies with unclear/blurry receipt**

**Expected Logs:**
```
INFO - üîç Running OCR on admin receipt for transaction #123
INFO - OCR result for transaction #123: {'amount': None, ...}
WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è Could not detect amount in admin receipt #123
```

**Expected Bot Response:**
- No warning shown
- Shows bank selection buttons
- Proceeds normally

**OCR failure doesn't block workflow** ‚úÖ

---

### Test Scenario 6: THB Transaction (No Verification)

**Steps:**
1. User exchange: MMK ‚Üí THB
2. Admin replies with receipt

**Expected Logs:**
```
INFO - Starting receipt verification for transaction #123, currency: THB, expected: 1000.0
INFO - Skipping OCR verification for transaction #123 (currency: THB, only MMK is verified)
```

**Expected Bot Response:**
- No OCR verification
- Shows bank selection buttons
- Proceeds normally

**Only MMK is verified** ‚úÖ

## How to View Logs

### Real-time Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Filter for Verification
```bash
docker-compose logs | grep -E "üîç|üí∞|‚úÖ|‚ö†Ô∏è|‚ùå"
```

### Filter for Specific Transaction
```bash
docker-compose logs | grep "transaction #123"
```

### Last 100 Lines
```bash
docker-compose logs --tail=100
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### OCR Not Running

**Check 1: Is photo being uploaded?**
```bash
docker-compose logs | grep "No photo in message"
```

**Check 2: Is it a reply?**
```bash
docker-compose logs | grep "No reply_to_message"
```

**Check 3: Is OCR service initialized?**
```bash
docker-compose logs | grep "OCR Service initialized"
```

**Check 4: Is extract_receipt_info method being called?**
```bash
docker-compose logs | grep "extract_receipt_info"
```

**Check 4: OpenAI API key valid?**
```bash
docker-compose exec exchange-bot env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### OCR Running But No Detection

**Check logs for OCR result:**
```bash
docker-compose logs | grep "OCR result"
```

If you see:
```
OCR result for transaction #123: {'amount': None, ...}
```

This means OCR ran but couldn't detect the amount. Possible reasons:
- Receipt image is unclear
- Amount format not recognized
- Receipt is in unexpected format

### No Logs at All

**Check if handler is registered:**
```bash
docker-compose logs | grep "Admin receipt handler triggered"
```

If not appearing, the handler might not be triggered. Check:
1. Is admin replying to the correct message?
2. Does the message contain "Transaction ID:" or "Buy"?

## Summary

‚úÖ **OCR Verification is Working If You See:**
- "üîç Running OCR on admin receipt"
- "üí∞ Amount detected"
- "‚úÖ Amount verified" or "‚ö†Ô∏è AMOUNT MISMATCH"

‚ùå **OCR Verification is NOT Working If:**
- No logs about OCR
- No "üîç Running OCR" message
- Errors in logs

üîß **To Fix:**
1. Check OpenAI API key
2. Check OCR service initialization
3. Check photo is being uploaded
4. Check admin is replying to transaction message
