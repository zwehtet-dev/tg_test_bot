# Complete Feature List - All Implemented ✅

## Overview

All requested features have been implemented and are ready for deployment!

---

## 1. MMK Amount Rounding ✅

### Feature
Automatically rounds all MMK amounts to the nearest 50 MMK.

### Rounding Rules
- **00-25**: Rounds down to 00
- **26-50**: Rounds up to 50  
- **51-99**: Rounds UP to next 00

### Examples
```
User sends 1,234.56 THB (Rate: 121.5)
→ Calculates: 149,999.04 MMK
→ Rounds: 150,000 MMK (99 rounds up)
→ User receives: 150,000 MMK

User sends 123,456 MMK
→ Rounds: 123,500 MMK (56 rounds up)
→ Calculates: 1,016.46 THB
→ User receives: 1,016.46 THB
```

### Implementation
- **File**: `app/utils/currency_utils.py`
- **Function**: `round_mmk_amount()`
- **Applied in**: User handlers, admin handlers, all calculations

### Benefits
- Cleaner amounts (all end in 00 or 50)
- Easier cash handling
- User-friendly (51-99 always rounds up)
- Consistent across all transactions

## 2. Admin Receipt Verification ✅

### Feature
Automatically verifies admin receipt shows correct MMK amount using OCR.

### How It Works

**User Flow:**
1. User sends THB → wants MMK
2. User uploads receipt
3. Bot extracts amount with OCR
4. Bot sends to admin group

**Admin Flow:**
1. Admin replies with receipt photo
2. **Bot runs OCR on admin receipt** ✅
3. **Bot extracts MMK amount** ✅
4. **Bot compares with expected amount** ✅
5. **Bot warns if mismatch > 1,000 MMK** ✅
6. Admin selects bank
7. Transaction confirmed

### Verification Logic

```python
Expected Amount: transaction.received_amount (MMK)
Detected Amount: OCR from admin receipt
Tolerance: 1,000 MMK

if |Detected - Expected| > 1,000:
    ⚠️ Show warning to admin
else:
    ✅ Amount verified, proceed
```

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Amount Matches ✅
```
Transaction: User receives 121,500 MMK
Admin Receipt: Shows 121,500 MMK
Difference: 0 MMK
Result: ✅ No warning, proceeds normally
```

#### Scenario 2: Small Difference ✅
```
Transaction: User receives 121,500 MMK
Admin Receipt: Shows 121,000 MMK
Difference: 500 MMK
Tolerance: 1,000 MMK
Result: ✅ Within tolerance, no warning
```

#### Scenario 3: Mismatch Warning ⚠️
```
Transaction: User receives 121,500 MMK
Admin Receipt: Shows 120,000 MMK
Difference: 1,500 MMK
Tolerance: 1,000 MMK
Result: ⚠️ Warning shown:

"⚠️ Amount Mismatch Warning

Transaction #123
Expected: 121,500 MMK
Detected: 120,000 MMK
Difference: 1,500 MMK

Please verify the receipt shows the correct amount before proceeding."
```

#### Scenario 4: Major Mismatch ⚠️
```
Transaction: User receives 121,500 MMK
Admin Receipt: Shows 100,000 MMK
Difference: 21,500 MMK
Result: ⚠️ Warning shown (likely wrong receipt)
```

### Implementation
- **File**: `app/handlers/admin_handlers.py`
- **Function**: `handle_admin_receipt()`
- **Lines**: 204-238
- **OCR Service**: Same as user receipts
- **Tolerance**: 1,000 MMK (configurable)

### Features
- ✅ Automatic verification
- ✅ OCR amount extraction
- ✅ 1,000 MMK tolerance
- ✅ Warning messages
- ✅ Non-blocking (admin can proceed)
- ✅ Logged for audit
- ✅ Only for MMK (where it matters most)

### Benefits
- Catches wrong amounts before confirmation
- Prevents sending incorrect amounts to users
- Quality control for admin receipts
- Audit trail for review
- Protects both admin and user

## 3. Complete User Flow Example

### THB → MMK Exchange

**Step 1: User Initiates**
```
User: /start
Bot: Shows exchange options
User: Selects "THB → MMK"
```

**Step 2: User Uploads Receipt**
```
User: Uploads receipt showing 1,234.56 THB
Bot: Runs OCR
Bot: Detects 1,234.56 THB
Bot: Calculates 149,999.04 MMK
Bot: Rounds to 150,000 MMK ✅
Bot: "You will receive 150,000 MMK"
```

**Step 3: User Confirms Bank Details**
```
User: Enters MMK bank account
Bot: Validates account
Bot: Sends to admin group
```

**Step 4: Admin Receives Notification**
```
Admin Group: New transaction notification
- User wants to exchange 1,234.56 THB
- Will receive 150,000 MMK
- User's MMK bank: KBZ - 123456789
```

**Step 5: Admin Uploads Receipt**
```
Admin: Replies with receipt photo
Bot: Downloads receipt
Bot: Runs OCR ✅
Bot: Detects 150,000 MMK ✅
Bot: Compares: Expected 150,000, Detected 150,000 ✅
Bot: Difference: 0 MMK (within 1,000 tolerance) ✅
Bot: "✅ Receipt saved for Transaction #123"
Bot: Shows bank selection buttons
```

**Step 6: Admin Confirms**
```
Admin: Selects "SCB" bank
Bot: Updates balances
Bot: Sends confirmation to user with admin receipt
User: Receives "✅ Payment Confirmed!" with receipt photo
```

### If Amount Mismatch

**Step 5 Alternative:**
```
Admin: Replies with receipt photo
Bot: Downloads receipt
Bot: Runs OCR ✅
Bot: Detects 145,000 MMK ✅
Bot: Compares: Expected 150,000, Detected 145,000 ✅
Bot: Difference: 5,000 MMK (exceeds 1,000 tolerance) ⚠️
Bot: Shows warning:
     "⚠️ Amount Mismatch Warning
      Expected: 150,000 MMK
      Detected: 145,000 MMK
      Difference: 5,000 MMK"
Bot: Still shows bank selection buttons
Admin: Can verify and proceed or upload new receipt
```

---

## 5. Configuration

### Adjust MMK Rounding

Edit `app/utils/currency_utils.py`:
```python
def round_mmk_amount(amount: float) -> float:
    # Current: Rounds to 50 with 51-99 rounding up
    # Modify logic here to change behavior
```

### Adjust Verification Tolerance

Edit `app/handlers/admin_handlers.py`:
```python
# Current: 1,000 MMK tolerance
tolerance = 1000

# Change to 2,000 MMK
tolerance = 2000

# Change to 500 MMK
tolerance = 500
```

### Enable Verification for THB

Edit `app/handlers/admin_handlers.py`:
```python
# Current: Only MMK
if to_currency == 'MMK':

# Change to include THB
if to_currency in ['MMK', 'THB']:
```

---

## 6. Testing

### Test MMK Rounding
```bash
python test_rounding.py
```

Expected output:
```
1,234,510 MMK → 1,234,500 MMK ✓
1,234,551 MMK → 1,234,600 MMK ✓
123,456 MMK → 123,500 MMK ✓
```

### Test Admin Verification

1. Create a transaction (user sends THB)
2. Admin uploads receipt with correct amount → No warning
3. Admin uploads receipt with wrong amount → Warning shown
4. Check logs for verification messages

---

## 7. Deployment

All features are ready to deploy:

```bash
# On VPS
cd /var/www/html/tg_test_bot
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

Expected logs:
```
✓ OCR Service initialized
✓ Bank accounts initialized (9 accounts)
✓ Exchange Bot initialized successfully!
```

When admin uploads receipt:
```
INFO - Verifying admin receipt amount for transaction #123
INFO - Admin receipt amount verified: 150000 MMK (expected 150000 MMK)
```

Or if mismatch:
```
WARNING - Amount mismatch in admin receipt #123: expected 150000, detected 145000
```
